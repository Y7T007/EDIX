## About the Project

Welcome to the repository for **EDIX**, an ambitious open-source project aiming to create the most beautiful, feature-rich, and intuitive code editor ever developed. This project is inspired by [Codium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) and seeks to take the experience to a whole new level.

Currently in the **conception phase**, this project envisions a code editor that not only performs exceptionally well but also provides a stunning user interface designed with developers in mind. A sneak peek of the proposed design, created in Figma, is available in the root of this project as `ui-design.png`.

## Our Vision

- **Aesthetic Excellence**: A visually pleasing and ergonomic user interface.
- **Seamless Performance**: Optimized for speed, reliability, and productivity.
- **Customizability**: Flexible configurations for developers of all backgrounds.
- **Community Driven**: Built by passionate developers for passionate developers.
